    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This apple crumble pie is a yummy version of apple pie with a rich crumb topping. It was a hit with my
        boyfriend's pals in university whenever I made this favorite!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (9 inch) deep dish pie crust</li>
        <li>5 cups apples - peeled, cored and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons cold butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C.)</li>
        <li>Arrange apple slices in unbaked pie shell. Mix 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over apples.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large, deep skillet. Add sausage and onion; cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown.
            Drain excess fat. Pour wine into the pan and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the
            bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>To make the crumble topping: Place 1/3 cup sugar and flour in a bowl. Cut in cold butter with 2 knives or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs; spoon mixture over apples.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until apples are soft and top is lightly browned, about 40 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
